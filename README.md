##Files

I have included the following files:
-	Run_analysis.R: a script that contains all the codes to perform the 5 steps to clean the original data.
-	dataset_means_tidy.txt: a text file with the tidy data after performing the analysis described in Run_analysis.R
-	Codebook.md: it describes the variables, the data and the transformations carried out to clean up the original data.
